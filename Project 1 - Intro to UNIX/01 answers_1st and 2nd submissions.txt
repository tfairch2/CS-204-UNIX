1st submission

1.	ps -ef, processes that are running
	ps -aux, how much memory and cpu processing is being used

	sort arranges it's list of files based on columns you list

	ls -l shows names of files in my directory, permissions & creation date/time
	ls -a shows filenames with bash info
	ls -b shows filenames only
	

2.  ps -ef|sort %mem > top_cpu_out.txt

3.  mkdir -m 750 user01

4.  chmod 751  chmod rwxrx---x

5.  commands that temporarily grant permissions

1.	ps -ef, processes that are running
	ps -aux, how much memory and cpu processing is being used


	sort arranges it's list of files based on columns you list
		k sorts by a key field
		n is a numeric indicating which column to sort by
		r causes the output to be listed in reverse order

	ls -l shows names of files in my directory, permissions & creation date/time
	ls -a shows filenames with bash info
	ls -b shows filenames only
	

2.  ps -aux|sort -k3nr|tail -10 >> top_cpu_out.txt

3.  mkdir -m 750 user01

4.  chmod 751  chmod rwxrx---x

5.  commands that temporarily grant permissions
